{- Saying :type THING gives you type of that thing (i.e. Bool, Char, etc.)
 - Haskell considers all strings as list of characters ([Char])
 - Haskell supports type synonyms (String is a synonym of Char)
 - "Hello World" :: String is valid
-}

{- Functions in Haskell also have a type!
 - Calling :t on a function gives the following format
 - FUNCTION :: INPUT_TYPE -> OUTPUT_TYPE
 - Ex. not :: Bool -> Bool
 - chr and ord functions convert from character to ASCII and vice versa
-}
